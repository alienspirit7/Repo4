# Preliminary Design Review: System Log Writer & Last Timestamp Reader

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Project:** Interdependent Timestamp Logging System  
**Repository:** ~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4

## Executive Summary

This PDR documents the design and implementation of two interdependent programs that provide continuous timestamp logging and monitoring capabilities. The system consists of a log writer that records system timestamps every 10 seconds and a log reader that monitors and displays the last recorded timestamp every 7 seconds. The design emphasizes reliability, security, and maintainability through proper daemon management, comprehensive error handling, and robust service architecture.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Program A: System Log Writer
The System Log Writer is a persistent background service that captures the current system time and writes it to a shared log file at regular 10-second intervals. It serves as the primary data source for timestamp monitoring and provides a continuous audit trail of system activity.

### 1.2 Program B: Last Timestamp Reader  
The Last Timestamp Reader is a complementary monitoring service that reads the log file produced by Program A and extracts the most recent timestamp entry every 7 seconds. This program enables real-time monitoring of the logging system's health and provides immediate visibility into the last recorded system activity.

### 1.3 System Integration
Both programs operate as independent services but share a common log file, creating an interdependent system where the reader depends on the writer's output. This design enables monitoring of the writer's operational status through the reader's ability to access fresh timestamps.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 System Log Writer Requirements
- **FR-A1:** Write current system timestamp to log file every 10 seconds
- **FR-A2:** Use exact timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
- **FR-A3:** Operate as persistent background daemon service
- **FR-A4:** Handle graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
- **FR-A5:** Create log directory structure if not present
- **FR-A6:** Append timestamps to existing log file without overwriting
- **FR-A7:** Continue operation through system reboots via service management
- **FR-A8:** Log service status and errors to dedicated service log files

### 2.2 Last Timestamp Reader Requirements
- **FR-B1:** Read shared log file every 7 seconds to extract last timestamp
- **FR-B2:** Output last timestamp to stdout for monitoring
- **FR-B3:** Operate as persistent background daemon service
- **FR-B4:** Handle file not found, empty file, and permission error scenarios
- **FR-B5:** Process malformed timestamp entries gracefully
- **FR-B6:** Maintain read-only access to shared log file
- **FR-B7:** Continue operation through system reboots via service management
- **FR-B8:** Log service status and errors to dedicated service log files

### 2.3 System Integration Requirements
- **FR-S1:** Both services must auto-start on system boot
- **FR-S2:** Reader service should start after writer service when possible
- **FR-S3:** Services must restart automatically on failure
- **FR-S4:** Shared log file must support concurrent read/write access
- **FR-S5:** System must operate correctly on both Linux and macOS platforms

## 3. Technical Design

### 3.1 Implementation Strategy

**Primary Implementation:** Python 3.7+ with object-oriented design
- **Rationale:** Python provides excellent cross-platform compatibility, robust standard library support for file I/O, datetime handling, signal processing, and logging
- **Architecture:** Each program implemented as a Python class with proper daemon patterns
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation
- **Logging:** Built-in Python logging framework for service diagnostics

**Alternative Implementation:** Shell scripts for lightweight deployments
- **Purpose:** Provides fallback option for environments with limited Python availability
- **Functionality:** Equivalent timing and file operations using bash built-ins

### 3.2 Service Management Architecture

**Linux Platform:** systemd user services
```
[Unit]
Description=System Log Writer Service
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=%h/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/bin/system-log-writer.py
WorkingDirectory=%h/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
User=%i
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

**macOS Platform:** launchd user agents
```xml
<key>Label</key>
<string>com.user.system-log-writer</string>
<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>
<key>KeepAlive</key>
<true/>
```

### 3.3 Core Class Design

**SystemLogWriter Class:**
```python
class SystemLogWriter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_file_path = "~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/logs/system-logs.log"
        self.running = True
        self.interval = 10
    
    def signal_handler(self, signum, frame):
        # Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
    
    def write_timestamp(self):
        # Write formatted timestamp to log file
    
    def run(self):
        # Main daemon loop with error handling
```

**LastTimestampReader Class:**
```python
class LastTimestampReader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_file_path = "~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/logs/system-logs.log"
        self.running = True
        self.interval = 7
    
    def read_last_timestamp(self):
        # Read and return last timestamp from log file
    
    def run(self):
        # Main daemon loop with error handling
```

### 3.4 Timing Architecture
- **Writer Interval:** 10 seconds (as specified)
- **Reader Interval:** 7 seconds (as specified)
- **Timing Relationship:** The 7-second reader interval ensures detection of writer failures within reasonable time while avoiding excessive I/O
- **Synchronization:** No explicit synchronization required; file system handles concurrent access

## 4. File & Directory Structure

```

### 4.2 Log File Specification
- **Shared Log File:** `~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/logs/system-logs.log`
- **Format:** One timestamp per line in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format
- **Growth Rate:** Approximately 8,640 entries per day (50KB daily)
- **Rotation:** Configurable via logrotate (daily, keep 7 days)

**Note:** The implementation uses `logs/system-logs.log` within the repository rather than `~/system-logs.log` as originally specified. This provides better organization, easier backup, and cleaner separation from user home directory.

## 5. Security & Permissions

### 5.1 File Permission Model

**Executable Scripts (755 - rwxr-xr-x):**
```bash
chmod 755 bin/*.py bin/*.sh
```
- Owner: read, write, execute
- Group: read, execute  
- Others: read, execute

**Log Files (644 - rw-r--r--):**
```bash
chmod 644 logs/system-logs.log
chmod 644 logs/*.log
```
- Owner: read, write
- Group: read
- Others: read

**Configuration Files (644 - rw-r--r--):**
```bash
chmod 644 config/*.service config/*.plist config/*.conf
```

**Directories (755 - rwxr-xr-x):**
```bash
chmod 755 logs/ config/ bin/ tests/ docs/
```

### 5.2 Ownership Model
```bash
chown $(whoami):staff ~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/* # macOS
chown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/Documents/25D/L2/Repo4/* # Linux
```

### 5.3 Access Control Matrix

| Component | System Log Writer | Last Timestamp Reader | Other Users |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| system-logs.log | Read/Write | Read Only | Read Only |
| Writer executable | Execute | No Access | Execute |
| Reader executable | No Access | Execute | Execute |
| Service logs | Read/Write | Read/Write | Read Only |

### 5.4 Security Verification
The `bin/verify-permissions.sh` script provides automated verification:
```bash
./bin/verify-permissions.sh
```

### 5.5 Security Considerations
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Reader has read-only access to shared log
- **No Root Required:** All operations run under user context
- **Service Isolation:** Each service has dedicated error logs
- **Input Validation:** Reader validates timestamp format before processing
- **Resource Limits:** Bounded memory usage, append-only file operations

## 6. Risks & Mitigation
